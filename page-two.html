    <p>Welcome, this is a new place.</p>

        <p class="chapter1">The tao that can be told is not the <em>eternal</em> Tao. The name that can be named is not the <em>eternal</em> Name. The <strong>unnamable</strong> is the eternally real. Naming is the origin of all particular things. Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source. This source is called <em>darkness</em>. Darkness within darkness. <em>The gateway to all understanding.</em></p>

        <p class="chapter2">When people see things as beautiful, <span class="highlight">ugliness is created.</span> When people see things as good, <span class="highlight">evil is created.</span> Being and non-being produce each other. Difficult and easy complement each other. Long and short define each other. High and low oppose each other. Fore and aft follow each other. Therefore the Master can act without doing anything and teach without saying a word. Things come her way and she does not stop them; things leave and she lets them go. She has without possessing, and acts without any expectations. When her work is done, she takes no credit. That is why it will last forever.</p>

        <p class="chapter3">Meng Po (Chinese: 孟婆; pinyin: Mèng Pó; Wade–Giles: Meng-p'o; lit. 'Old Lady Meng') is the goddess of forgetfulness in Chinese mythology, who serves Meng Po Soup on the Bridge of Forgetfulness or Naihe Bridge (Chinese: 奈何桥; pinyin: Nàihé qiáo). This soup wipes the memory of the person so they can reincarnate into the next life without the burdens of the previous life. She awaits the dead souls at the entrance of the 9th round Fengdu (Chinese: 丰都; pinyin: fēng dū).</p>
