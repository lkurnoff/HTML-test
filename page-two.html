    <h1>Hello Other World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome, this is a new place.</p>
    <div class="top-section">
        <p class="chapter1">The tao that can be told
            is not the <em>eternal</em> Tao
            The name that can be named
            is not the <em>eternal</em> Name.
            
            The <strong>unnamable</strong> is the eternally real.
            Naming is the origin
            of all particular things. 
            Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
            Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.
            
            Yet mystery and manifestations
            arise from the same source.
            This source is called <em>darkness</em>.
            
            Darkness within darkness.
            <em>The gateway to all understanding.</em></p>

        <p class="chapter2">When people see things as beautiful,
            <span class="highlight">ugliness is created.</span>
            When people see things as good,
            <span class="highlight">evil is created.</span>
            Being and non-being produce each other.
            Difficult and easy complement each other.
            Long and short define each other.
            High and low oppose each other.
            Fore and aft follow each other.
            Therefore the Master
            can act without doing anything
            and teach without saying a word.
            Things come her way and she does not stop them;
            things leave and she lets them go.
            She has without possessing,
            and acts without any expectations.
            When her work is done, she takes no credit.
            That is why it will last forever.</p>
